## 3D Plotting

The implementation of this script is to make a 3D plot of a function of two variables x,y.

## Libraries:

```
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import cm
```

## The Funtion

the function is located in the file named "3d_plotting.py" and defined as follows:
```
plot_values(x,y,func)
```
where:
- x: the range of x on which we are going to create the plot
- y: the range of y on which we are going to create the plot
- func: the function used using x,y variables in order to get the z values for the plot


## Running the Script

```
line 28 to 29:      func(x,y)    please write the function of interest
line 31: range of x 
line 32: range of y
line 36: x,y,z=plot_values(x, y, func) after providing the above values, please run this code in order the values x,y,z for the plot
line 39 to 49: those are needed for the plot
line 48: you can the change the elevation angle using [elev] and the rotation angle using [azim]
```

## Exmaple

 I have provided an example of the following function $$x^{3}-6*x*y+y^{3}$$
